    "1. go to your ketos user interface and request a new dataset. Once your dataset has been prepared for you, you can access it from within this notebook, to do this just substitute the string \n",

    "to deploy the notebook in order to allow for external predictions just do the following:\n",

    "1. tag the cells that you would like to be executed for your prediction with the keyword \"ketos_predict\" in the first line of each cell as a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. tag the cells which produce the output for the prediction with the keyword \"ketos_predict_output\", please note that this cell will be executed and the output will be used as return value for the prediction. It is expected to be in json format as supplied by the \"format_to_json\" function provided here.\n",
